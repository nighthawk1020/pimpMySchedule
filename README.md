look at manifest.json for how to easily add scripts to specific pages, using content_scripts.

I think it's a little weird (and annoying) that I manually navigate to the schedule page when I can just, say, start a PMS session on prompt instead of forcing myself to turn the extension off because it keeps redirecting me.

Occurs on URL: /banner/bwckgens.p_proc_term_date
60 minute login class node:
document.getElementsByClassName("errortext")[0];
document.getElementsByClassName("errortext")[0].innerText == "60 minute inactivity caused web session timeout. ";
