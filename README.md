look at manifest.json for how to easily add scripts to specific pages, using content_scripts.

I think it's a little weird (and annoying) that I manually navigate to the schedule page when I can just, say, start a PMS session on prompt instead of forcing myself to turn the extension off because it keeps redirecting me.
