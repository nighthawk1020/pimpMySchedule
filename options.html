<h1> Hi </h1>
<body> <p> This is where the classes you'd register for would go. (in an appropriately sized text box below)</p>
<p> Syntax would be something like SECTION - CRN (Lab/Act_CRN_In_Order_Of_Pref, Other_Lab/Act_CRN, etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p> Some arbitrary distance below, a save button, which would load the classes into chrome.storage, where it's accessible to the rest of the extension.</p> </body>
